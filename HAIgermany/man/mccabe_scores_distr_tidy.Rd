\title{McCabe Score Distribution by Age Group and Infection Type}
\format{
A tibble with columns:
\describe{
\item{AgeGroup}{Age group of the patients (e.g., "20-24", "25-29")}
\item{Infection}{Type of healthcare-associated infection (e.g., "UTI", "SSI")}
\item{PatientsAtRisk}{Number of patients at risk for that infection in the age group}
}
}
\source{
BHAI dataset (ECDC Point Prevalence Survey 2011â€“2012)

\usage{
mccabe_scores_distr_tidy
}
\description{
A tidy dataset summarizing the distribution of McCabe scores across different
age groups and types of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Each row
represents a unique combination of age group and infection type, with the total
number of patients at risk of that infection in that age group.
}
\details{
Note that the counts represent patients at risk, not only those who actually
developed the infection. For example, patients at risk of surgical site infections
(SSI) are only those who underwent surgery, while patients at risk of urinary
tract infections (UTI) are those with a urinary catheter.
